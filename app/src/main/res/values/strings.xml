        Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money.
        Anyone with a smart phone or computer can install a wallet and send and receive it.
        Creating a wallet only requires a wallet app to generate a large random number.
        To receive Bitcoin Cash just create a wallet and give someone an \"address\"
        (hash of one of your wallet\'s public keys).
        To send Bitcoin Cash just enter someone else\'s \"address\" into your wallet and create a
        transaction to pay them.

    <string name="what_is_bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</string>
    <string name="what_is_bitcoin_answer">
        Bitcoin is an open source software project that is attempting to build a worldwide
        decentralized currency. Its goal is to allow people to pay each other without dependence on
        any company or government and without requiring permission from any company or government.
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_bitcoin_cash">What is Bitcoin Cash?</string>
    <string name="what_is_bitcoin_cash_answer">
        Bitcoin Cash is a branch of the Bitcoin project that is focused on increasing capacity and
        increasing usability and adoption. This wallet exclusively uses Bitcoin Cash. If you held
        Bitcoin on August 1st, 2017 then you hold that amount of Bitcoin Cash because the ledger
        up until that point is the same for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
    </string>

    <string name="how_do_i_get_bitcoin_cash">How do I get Bitcoin Cash?</string>
    <string name="how_do_i_get_bitcoin_cash_answer">
        You can get Bitcoin Cash from anyone who has some and is willing to part with it to show you
        how it works. Just ask them to send you a little. Most people will be happy to.
        If you can\'t find anyone to give you some for free, or you want more than that, you can buy
        Bitcoin Cash and other major cryptocurrencies from Coinbase.com. They are a large exchange
        based in the United States.
        They will charge you a small fee to convert your money into cryptocurrency.
        If you use this link or the button on the main screen to sign up, then you will get $10 free
        when you buy $100 or more.

    <string name="why_use_bitcoin_cash">
        Why should I use Bitcoin Cash as opposed to other payment options?
    </string>

    <string name="why_use_bitcoin_cash_answer">
        Bitcoin Cash allows you to send money digitally to anyone in the world nearly
        instantaneously. It requires no third party like a bank or PayPal. Your transaction is
        transmitted to a peer to peer network and if accepted will be included and secured in the
        block chain that becomes more immutable (unchangeable) as blocks are added to it.
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_ibd">
        What is the initial block download?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_ibd_answer">
        Initial Block Download (IBD) is required every time a new \"node\" starts.
        It will only have to be done once after you install this app.
        It is the process of querying the network for blocks to find the block chain with the most
        \"proof of work\".
        After finding the block chain with the most \"proof of work\", downloading, and verifying
        each block header, your \"node\" (App) can then verify if transactions have been included in
        that block chain.
        This normally takes around an hour depending on the latency of your internet.
        It requires several hundred megabytes of data usage, so should be done on WiFi if possible.
        You may have to open the app occasionally to keep the download running as your phone may
        stop it after a while.
    </string>

    <string name="why_does_my_wallet_say_synchronizing">
        Why does my wallet say \"synchronizing\"?
    </string>

    <string name="why_does_my_wallet_say_synchronizing_answer">
        When your wallet says \"synchronizing\" under the name, that means the app is still querying
        the network to find transactions in the block chain that relate to your wallet.
        Either pay to or send from.
        This should only happen when you \"recover\" a wallet and the app is unsure of previous
        activity with that wallet.
        Creating a new wallet will not do this because there is no possibility of previous
        transactions.
    </string>

    <string name="why_does_my_wallet_say_needs_backup">
        Why does my wallet say \"synchronizing\"?
    </string>

    <string name="why_does_my_wallet_say_needs_backup_answer">
        When your wallet says \"Needs Backed Up\" under the name, that means you have not yet
        verified that you have written down the \"mnemonic seed\".
        You need to write down the mnemonic seed (list of words) to be able to recover your bitcoins
        if anything happens to your device.
        If you lose your mobile device or it breaks, and you do not have the seed, then no one can
        give your money back to you.
        This is because Bitcoin Cash is decentralized and no one has access to modify anyone else\'s
        bitcoins without knowing the private keys.
        If you do have your seed written down you can install most Bitcoin Cash wallet apps and
        enter your seed in the recover option to regain access to your bitcoins.
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_mnemonic_seed">
        What is a \"mnemonic seed\"?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_mnemonic_seed_answer">
        A mnemonic seed is a randomly generated list of words that represent numbers.
        Combined they represent a very large number, often with a checksum, that is used to derive
        the private keys for a wallet.
        Private keys are large numbers that give you access to send bitcoins.
        Anyone with your seed or private keys can send your bitcoins to anyone they want so be
        careful when storing your seed and who you give access to it.
        It is a good idea to write it on paper and put it in a safe or somewhere that you would
        store money.
    </string>

    <string name="what_are_confirms">
        What are confirms?
    </string>

    <string name="what_are_confirms_answer">
        Confirms, or confirmations, is the count of the number of blocks built on top of the block
        that a transaction is in.
        Each block built on top of the block a transaction is in greatly reduces the chances of
        the transaction every being removed from the block chain.

        What is a double spend?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_double_spend_answer">
        A double spend is a fraudulent action involving sending a payment to someone, then making a
        new transaction paying someone else or themselves with the same bitcoins.
        This can invalidate a transaction previously sent as bitcoins, like all good money, can only
        be spent once.
        When a transaction is pending (not in a block yet) it is possible that there is another
        transaction out there that conflicts with it and can invalidate it if included in a block.
        The more nodes that have accepted your transaction while pending, the more likely it is that
        it is valid and will be included in a block.

        Why does it say I need to \"use pending\" when I have enough balance not pending?
    </string>

    <string name="why_does_it_say_i_need_to_use_pending_answer">
        When you send a payment you \"cash in\" a certain amount of \"coins\" of varying amounts,
        also called UTXOs.
        Usually the total amount you \"cash in\" is more than what you are sending.
        So you send the remaining balance back to yourself in a \"change\" address.
        If a previous send transaction is still pending, then so is the \"change\" which you may
        need to make the next payment.
        If you \"use pending\", then this transaction can\'t confirm until the pending transaction
        has confirmed.
        They can confirm at the same time though and that is most likely.
        It is up to the merchant whether they will accept payments based on pending UTXOs or not, so
        do it with caution.

    <string name="what_are_the_units">
        What are the units of Bitcoin?
    </string>

    <string name="what_are_the_units_answer">
        There are many units of measure in Bitcoin.
        The smallest unit is called a \"satoshi\".
        The common unit is called a \"bitcoin\". A bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis.
        Another common unit is \"bits\". A bitcoin is equal to 100 bits.
        \"Bitcoin\" with a upper case \"B\" is the system and/or project.
        \"bitcoin\" with a lower case \"b\" is a unit of Bitcoin.
        This app uses a space delimited format for representing quantities that looks like this
        \"1 23 456 678\". Where the entire number is the satashis.
        The number before the first space is bitcoins.
        The numbers combined before the second space is the bits.

    <string name="what_is_a_bitcoin_address">
        What is a Bitcoin address?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_bitcoin_address_answer">
        A Bitcoin address is a hash of a public key.
        It allows anyone to create a Bitcoin transaction sending bitcoins to the owner of the public
        key.
        There are many types of Bitcoin transactions in Bitcoin, but the standard transaction allows
        the coins to be spent by providing the full public key associated with a specified hash and
        proving access to the private key of that public key with a signature.

    <string name="what_is_a_hash">
        What is a hash?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_hash_answer">
        A hash is a method of turning a set of data into a specific value that can be repeated, but
        not reversed.
        For example anyone could take the data set and create the same hash data from it, but no one
        could take the hash and figure out the data set that created it.
        They can only verify that the data set corresponds to the hash when given both.

    <string name="what_is_a_bitcoin_key">
        What is a Bitcoin key?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_a_bitcoin_key_answer">
        A Bitcoin key is a generated value that can be used for cryptographic functions.
        A private key can sign and decrypt data.
        A public key can verify signatures and encrypt data.
        In Bitcoin public keys can be used to verify signatures to cryptographically prove that the
        creator of a transaction has the private key associated with the public key.

    <string name="what_is_proof_of_work">
        What is proof of work?
    </string>

    <string name="what_is_proof_of_work_answer">
        Proof of work involves using bulk cryptographic operations to solve a problem to prove that
        a miner spent actual effort to produce something.
        Proof of work is one of the backbones of Bitcoin, along with cryptographic signatures.
        Signatures allow nodes to prove ownership of public keys.
        Proof of work allows nodes to verify the ledger that is agreed upon by the most miners.
        Proof of work provides immutability (inability to change) the ledger, since any good money
        requires an immutable ledger.
